**Details**: Explain why Scrumban is preferred more over Kanban?

**Answer:**
Scrumban is a combination of the scrum and kanban methodologies. It incorporates boards and continuous work from kanban, together with regular meetings and task limitations from scrum. It has certain advantages depending on the nature of the project.
For example, it is better than scrum for **ongoing maintenance work**, as it removes the sprint-based system. It is also better than kanban if you have consistent bottlenecks, as it limits the number of simultaneous items on a board. Scrumban removes **the time limits of scrum** and makes work continuous, but retains scrum's short stand-up meetings. I also find that the regular standup meetings are a good way of incorporating feedback, which is common to both scrum and kanban. The focus on **task prioritisation** rather than assigned roles also makes things much more flexible, which is good for developing a team of collaborative and interdependent people.

**Details**: Does Kanban encourage continues improvement?


**Answer:**
Kanban encourages **continuous improvement**, also known as **Kaizen** in Lean Project Management.
By continuously improving every process in your company, you can maximize value to both your business and your customers while minimizing the waste along the way.
Therefore, let's see how Kanban encourages continuous improvement.
**Visualizing the workflow with Kanban**
Everyone has heard about Kanban Board and how it helps visualize the workflow. However, there's more to it than just visualization. As a matter of fact, Kanban boards, when visible to everyone in the team, help spark conversations, discussions, collaborations and plans. 
**Minimizing and simplifying**
As mentioned before, Kanban is about reducing waste on the way towards continuous improvement. However, any waste cannot be completely eradicated, it's simply impossible to achieve. Still, you can always minimize waste and reduce its negative effects on both business and customer value. 
**Decentralized leadership**
The Kanban framework doesn't recognize any official processes nor does it define any specific roles. The purpose is to, in fact, encourage continuous improvement. But how does it work? Simply put, in order to find the best solution and not just the fastest, everyone must participate and voice their opinions. 
**Continuous Improvement as a Culture**
Continues improvement should be made part of the culture and not just something you read about online. It's up to leaders to inspire team members to adopt this mindset and strive towards improving both themselves and the work they do. There are a number of ways you can approach this matter. 
Leaders motivate employees through flexibility, appreciation, rewards and other forms of stimuli. It's important to know your team well so that you can motivate them the best way possible.

**Details**: Give me an example of kanban principle and explain what it means.



**Answer:**
An important kanban principle is that of **incremental change.** This is because kanban is not supposed to totally overhaul your workflows and cause resistance, but rather to evolve them over time through smaller, incremental adaptations and changes. This also incorporates feedback and collaboration from all the people involved to ensure that everyone is working harmoniously. 
I can also mention another important principle: **encouraging leadership** acts from everyone, rather than just senior managers. This encourages people to contribute ideas and therefore improve products, services and their delivery.
